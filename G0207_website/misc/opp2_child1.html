    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="opportunity-card">
      <p>By focusing on digital literacy education, fact-checking and verification, regulation and policy, and adopting a collaborative approach, we can enhance our ability to identify and counter fake information. These solutions provide opportunities for individuals, society, and democracy as a whole. <br><br>
       <strong> Digital Literacy Education:</strong> One of the key preventive measures is enhancing individuals' digital literacy skills. By educating people on critical thinking, media literacy, and recognizing common disinformation tactics, we empower them to critically evaluate information. State-based initiatives can play a pivotal role in implementing digital literacy education on a large scale.  <br><br>
       <strong> Fact-Checking and Verification:</strong> Fact-checking organizations and technology companies have a significant role to play in detecting and debunking disinformation. Rigorous verification processes and making fact-checks widely available and easy to understand are crucial. Leveraging technologies such as LLMs and AI can also aid in the detection of disinformation, complementing human efforts.  <br><br>
       <strong> Regulation and Policy:</strong> Governments and international bodies can develop policies and regulations to curb disinformation. Holding social media platforms accountable for spreading disinformation and imposing sanctions on entities involved in disinformation campaigns can be effective measures. Enforcing sanctions or international penalties on state actors engaged in aggressive disinformation campaigns can discourage such behavior.  <br><br>
       <strong> Collaborative Approach:</strong> A collaborative approach involving governments, tech companies, civil society, and media can enhance the effectiveness of combating disinformation. Sharing best practices, research, and tools to detect and counter disinformation can foster a collective effort. Collaboration can also facilitate the development of comprehensive strategies to address disinformation at a global level.  <br><br>
